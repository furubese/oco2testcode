# Changelog - AWS CDK Migration Specification

## Version 1.1 - 2025-10-30

### Updated Based on Project Requirements

#### Scope Clarification
- **Project Type**: Changed from "production-ready" to **prototype**
- **Purpose**: Phase 2 is a prototype deployment to AWS, not a production system
- **Future Plans**: Documented plans for Amazon Bedrock integration

#### Performance Requirements
- **Cache Miss Latency**: Updated target from 6s to **<10 seconds**
- **Availability**: Changed from 99.9% to **standard prototype availability**
- **Multi-AZ**: Removed requirement (moved to future production phase)

#### CloudFront Configuration
- **HTML/JS/CSS Cache TTL**: Updated from 1 hour to **<8 hours**
- **GeoJSON Cache TTL**: Updated from 24 hours to **<72 hours**
- **Custom Domain**: Clarified as **managed externally** (not within AWS)
- **SSL Certificate**: Changed from ACM-requested to **imported from external source**

#### Data Migration
- **cache.json Migration**: **Removed** - this is a cache file, not persistent data
- **DynamoDB Table**: Will start **empty** and populate naturally as users make requests
- **Migration Script**: Removed (no longer needed)

#### Future Enhancements
Added section documenting planned improvements:
1. **Amazon Bedrock Integration**: Replace Gemini API with Amazon Bedrock
2. **Production Hardening**: Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
3. **Advanced Monitoring**: Enhanced CloudWatch dashboards and alerts

### Files Modified

1. **spec.md**
   - Executive Summary: Updated objectives for prototype
   - Scope: Added "Out of Scope" and "Future Enhancements" sections
   - Phase 2 Data Layer: Removed cache migration steps
   - Non-Functional Requirements: Updated latency and availability targets
   - Success Metrics: Adjusted performance targets for prototype

2. **diagrams/phase2-architecture.md**
   - Title: Added "Prototype" designation
   - CloudFront: Updated cache TTL values and SSL/domain configuration
   - Reliability: Clarified as prototype-level
   - Migration Path: Removed cache migration, added Bedrock plans

3. **diagrams/data-flow.md**
   - Cache Miss Performance: Updated latency from 2-6s to 2-10s
   - Performance Tables: Updated all Phase 2 latency targets to <10s

### Key Differences from Version 1.0

| Aspect | Version 1.0 | Version 1.1 |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Deployment Type** | Production-ready | Prototype |
| **Cache Miss Latency** | <6s | <10s |
| **Availability Target** | 99.9% (Multi-AZ) | Standard (prototype) |
| **HTML/CSS Cache TTL** | 1 hour | <8 hours |
| **GeoJSON Cache TTL** | 24 hours | <72 hours |
| **Custom Domain** | AWS Route53 | External management |
| **SSL Certificate** | ACM-requested | Imported from external |
| **cache.json Migration** | Full migration script | Not required (cache file) |
| **Future AI Service** | Gemini API only | Plan for Bedrock integration |

### Backward Compatibility

- All core architecture diagrams remain valid
- CDK stack structure unchanged
- Migration phases still applicable (with updated Phase 2 data layer)
- Cost estimates remain accurate

### Next Steps

1. Review updated specification
2. Proceed with CDK implementation based on prototype requirements
3. Plan for future Bedrock integration architecture
4. Document production hardening requirements separately
