2. **Lambda Cold Start Latency (MEDIUM)**
   - Mitigation: Provisioned concurrency, keep warm, optimize dependencies

3. **DynamoDB Cost Overrun (MEDIUM)**
   - Mitigation: Cost monitoring, budgets, TTL

4. **CORS Configuration Errors (LOW)**
   - Mitigation: Testing, documentation

5. **Cache Migration Data Loss (LOW)**
   - Mitigation: Backup, validation, retry logic

**All Risks:** Have documented mitigation strategies in spec.md

   cd cdk
   cdk init app --language=typescript
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create DynamoDB Table**

   - Partition key: `cache_key` (String)
   - Billing: On-Demand
   - Encryption: AWS Managed
   - TTL: 90 days

4. **Store Gemini API Key**
   - Create secret in AWS Secrets Manager
   - Name: `gemini-api-key`
   - Value: Copy from `.env` file

5. **Create S3 Bucket**
   - Define in CDK code
   - Enable static website hosting
   - Configure public read access
   - Upload `sample_calendar.html`

6. **Deploy Infrastructure**
